# CampusCore: Academic Portal Solution 🎓

A robust internal network solution that started as a simple fix for SSL issues and evolved into the primary academic portal for my college. Now serving hundreds of daily users including students, professors, and staff.

## Why This Exists 🤔
Our college website was constantly going down due to SSL issues and unreliable hosting. Modern browsers would block access, marking it as unsafe. Instead of watching everyone struggle, I decided to build something that would actually work.

## What it Does 🚀
- Quick access to student results
- Detailed student profiles
- Handles user authentication
- Works smoothly on local network
- Super fast response times
- Clean, simple interface

## Evolution Through Versions 📈

### V1: The Beginning
- Basic implementation with Python requests
- Core functionality established
- Simple but working solution

### V2: Getting Serious
- Async implementation
- Added data caching
- Concurrent page fetching
- Significantly faster load times

### V3: The Game Changer
- Rebuilt with HTTPX
- Enhanced session management
- Better error handling
- Lightning fast responses
- Rock-solid reliability

## Tech Stack 💻
- Python (Core)
- Flask (Web Framework)
- HTTPX (HTTP Client)
- Async Programming
- Session Management
- Network Analysis Tools

## Key Features ⭐
- Local network deployment
